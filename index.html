                <h1>About the club</h1>
                <p>
                    The SuperNova Research Club was founded in the 2024-2025 school year through the
                    efforts of the student council.
                
                    The club's purpose is to bring a variety of opportunities in research and higher
                    education to SuperNovians and ensure they have access to high quality guidance and
                    resources to guarantee their future success in the real world in all fields, including
                    higher education, academia and the workforce.
                </p>

                <h1>Why do research? Isn't that hard?</h1>
                <p>
                    While it's true that often times research is not an easy feat, that doesn't make it
                    any less worthwhile as a project!

                    According to the club's own research, the 2/3 Pakistanis who received offers of admission
                    to Harvard University in the 2023-2024 school year all had crowning awards in research,
                    and many more candidates admitted to top schools, including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, 
                    Duke, Princeton, Stanford and others! Don't believe us? Here are some profiles, their school, city,
                    what they researched and any other relevant info!
                </p>

                    potential pathway to a top global school?
